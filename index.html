      <p>Hello World...</p>
      <p>
        Degenerate Capital is a new type of hedge fund, built
        <strong>by zoomers, for boomers</strong>. The world and its rules are
        changing faster than ever, and the average investor is missing out on
        whole classes of investment opportunities that frankly, are obvious to
        the youngsters in the tech community. Call us crazy, zoomers,
        degenerates, whatever you want, but gen-z has a power to move markets,
        to create real change, and in general, we have uniquely powerful
        intuition when it comes to what's up and coming in the technology
        sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Degenerate Capital is fundamentally about giving you, a boomer, access
        to the investments and opportunites that are unique to gen-z, the stuff
        that you need to get your grandkids to explain to you. You don't need to
        do any work, or read anything with big words, just entrust your money
        with us and know that you're investing in the future of technology and
        innovation.
